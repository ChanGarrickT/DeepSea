Like plants on land, they take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen and nutrients, forming the base of the ocean's food chain. Diatoms are the most abundant. Their tough cell walls are made of silica, the same material used to make glass."

In some places, kelp, a brown algae, grow tall and densely to form kelp forests. Certain species of seaweed have gas-filled bulbs to help the algae stay afloat. Together, phytoplankton and large algae produce about half of the world's oxygen."
